.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]. shira.sh\f[] activates the shira function, for cat\@tty
detection.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]. shira\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[B]source shira\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads the "shira" function into bash (other shells have not been
tested).
If the cat enters the keyboard, while the bash session is active, and
rubs its head at the edge, where 0,+ and Enter are locaated at the
keyboard, it might trigger a command like \f[C]000,0000,,000++++\f[]
which would normally lead to the \f[C]command_not_found_handle\ ()\f[]
function to kick in (not installed on every distro).
.PP
This function checks the syntax, and if it matches \f[C]"^[,0+\-]*$\f[],
the message \f[C]Hallo\ Shira\f[] is displayed (which you should adjust
to the name of your cat, if it isn\[aq]t "Shira".
Additionally a sound sample, "shira.wav" is played, which is not
provided.
You have to record[1] something yourself.
For me, it just consists of my voice, saying "Hallo Shira".[2].
.PP
If the detected command does not match the cat pattern, the normal
command_not_found_handle, in Ubuntu\-18.04 installed in
\f[C]/etc/bash.bashrc\f[], is continued, but it\[aq]s a copy of the
function, found on my system, so you might compare yours with the
provided one.
.SS Options

(None)
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /home/USER/lib/helloMyCat.wav
Audio file to play, when cat is estimated.

.SH NOTES
.SS [1]
.PP
For recording, I can recommend \f[C]arecord\f[] with a sensible timeout,
like \f[C]arecord\ \-d\ 3s\ helloMyCat.wav\f[].
.SS [2]
.PP
If you have forgotten the name of your cat, just say "Hello, my cat!"
